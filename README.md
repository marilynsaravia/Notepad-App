# Notepad App

A simple and static web-based Notepad application to create and organize personal notes.

## Description

This application was built using **React** and offers a minimal and intuitive user experience for writing and organizing notes.
It is currently in development — the current version includes a **Navbar**, **Categories**, **Notes** display, and **Footer**, with more features coming soon.

Planned features:
- Create new notes
- View and manage notes
- Edit and delete notes
- Save notes to local storage

## Design Process

This section showcases the visual evolution of the app, from the first sketches to the current layout.  
These designs were created as part of the planning process before implementing the core functionality.  
Initial drafts were created in **Canva** for quick visualization, and the next step will be to migrate the design to **Figma** for a more polished and professional look.



### **Step 1 — Basic Layout**

The first draft focused on the main structure:
- **Navigation bar** with a search bar and dark mode toggle.
- **Category tags** to filter notes.
- A notes grid, with the first card reserved for adding a new note.

### **Step 2 — Adding Core Actions**

This iteration introduced elements aimed at functionality:
- Form to **create a note** with title, description, category, and color options.
- **Edit** and **Delete** buttons to manage notes.
- Design improvements for better readability.
